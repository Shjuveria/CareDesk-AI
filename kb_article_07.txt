1. Confirm patientâ€™s height and weight are updated in the demographics section.
2. Recalculate the Body Surface Area (BSA) in the patient profile.
3. Reenter the order to trigger dosage auto-calculation based on updated metrics.

Notes:
For pediatric or oncology patients, double-check order sets as custom protocols may override defaults.
