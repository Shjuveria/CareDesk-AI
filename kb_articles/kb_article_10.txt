Category: Documentation
Keywords: encounter, note, documentation error, association failed

1. Ensure the correct active encounter is selected before opening the documentation tab.
2. Remove any partially saved notes linked to incorrect encounters.
3. Re-initiate the note creation process from the right encounter context.

Notes:
Encounter association errors may lead to documentation appearing in the wrong patient record.
