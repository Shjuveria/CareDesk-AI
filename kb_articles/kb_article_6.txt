1. Ensure the Cerner imaging plugin is installed and up to date.
2. Check that the user has PACS access rights in both Cerner and the imaging system.
3. Relaunch the PACS viewer after clearing the browser’s temporary files.

Notes:
Some PACS systems require specific Java versions—confirm compatibility before changes.
